== Neo4j GitHub Import for Community Graph (and other uses)

Currently uses Python and iPython Notebook, the GitHub GraphQL API via requests.

Run the script and notebook server with these environment variables:

.nb.sh
----
cat ../nb.sh 
export NEO4J_URL=bolt://localhost
export NEO4J_USER=neo4j
export NEO4J_PASSWORD=****
export GITHUB_TOKEN=****

ipython notebook 
----

=== Approach

* Use GitHub GraphQL API with pre-authorized URL to retrieve non-fork repositories that have neo4j in their name or description (or perhaps readme?)
* Use idempotent Cypher statement to merge Repositories, Users, Issues, Pull Requests, Tags, Languages
* page over the data until all is imported

        homepageURL,
        issues {totalCount},
        owner {id,login}
      }
    }
  }
}

=== Data Model

Uses the GitHub part of this data model:

image::https://github.com/community-graph/documentation/raw/master/community_graph.png[]


=== Queries

Latest 100 repositories by stars.

----
MATCH (n:Repository) WITH n ORDER BY n.created desc LIMIT 100 
RETURN n.title, n.url, n.created, n.favorites, n.description 
ORDER BY n.favorites DESC
----

=== TODO

* store responses in json files and then import those
